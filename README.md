# React Image Viewer

This mini website project showcases my proficiency in React, JavaScript, and Typescript, along with my expertise in data structures and problem-solving. The primary goal is to create an Image Viewer with the following features:

## Features

### A. Upload Image
Allows users to upload an image from their local drive.

### B. Display Panel
A panel that displays the uploaded image.

### C. Hide Selected Area
Enables users to select any part of the image and hide the selected area by:
- Saving the selected area's coordinates and data buffer into Image Metadata.
- Adding a black box over the selected area.

### D. Show Selected Area
Enables users to show the hidden area by:
- Removing the black box from the selected area.
- Reading the selected area data from Image Metadata and pushing the data back to the image.

### E. Show All
Allows users to reveal all hidden areas at once.

### F. Download
Enables users to download the edited image.
